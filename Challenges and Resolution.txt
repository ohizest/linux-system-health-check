Git/GitHub Challenges Faced & Solutions
1. SSH Authentication Issues
Problem:

git push was hanging or failing to authenticate, even after adding the SSH key.

Terminal was stuck in a flashing loop when trying to push.

Debugging Steps:

Verified SSH connection with ssh -T git@github.com (initially hung).

Discovered network/firewall restrictions blocking port 22 (default SSH).

Solution:

Configured SSH to use port 443 (HTTPS) instead:

bash
cat >> ~/.ssh/config <<EOF
Host github.com
  Hostname ssh.github.com
  Port 443
  User git
EOF
Tested again with ssh -T git@github.com → Success! ✅

Branch Mismatch (main vs master)
Problem:

Error:

text
error: src refspec main does not match any
Local default branch was master, but remote expected main.

Solution:

Renamed local branch to match remote:

bash
git branch -m master main
git push -u origin main

Final Resolution ✅
After:
✔ Fixing SSH connectivity (port 443)
✔ Correcting remote URL (HTTPS → SSH)
✔ Resolving submodule confusion
✔ Aligning branch names (master → main)

Result:

Successful push:
